# IntelliJ IDEA

## Switch Test Runner

This repository contains tests written in `unittest` style and `pytest` styles.
`pytest` style is used by default. IntelliJ IDEA cannot support both test
runners at the same time. To switch runners, you need to:

    Preferences > Search "testing"

or

    Preferences > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Testing > Default test runner
